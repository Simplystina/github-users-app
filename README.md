### Github Users Project

The github-users-app is a web app that displays basic information about any github users. It utilizes auth0 for user authentication. The app lets users search for any github user, display information about that user if the user exists, and displays a chart for easy visualization. 

The live link can be found [here](https://githubappusers.netlify.app)

To get started with auth0 for authentication in react application, please visit this [url](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/react/interactive#add-login-to-your-application)

To run the file in localhost, please clone this repo on your local machine, open vs code editor and start the react application with npm start


The github api documentation that I used can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-rest-api)
